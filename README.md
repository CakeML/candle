# The Candle Interactive Theorem Prover

This repository contains the Candle theorem prover sources. The repository is a
fork of John Harrison's HOL Light sources, which are available in the repository
here: [https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light).
The original README of this repository can be found [here](README.hol-light).

This repository differs from the original HOL Light repository in that some
files have been patched to work with the Candle theorem prover. It also contains
some custom ML source files required to run Candle (these carry the prefix
candle_ in their filenames). The patches are stored under
[candle_patches/](candle_patches/).

# Features

- Candle is a verified implementation of HOL Light, and comes with a mechanized
  end-to-end soundness result which encompasses the entire theorem proving system.
  Read our ITP'22 paper on Candle for more information: [Candle: A Verified Implementation of HOL Light](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2022/16712/pdf/LIPIcs-ITP-2022-3.pdf).
- Candle comes with a fast in-logic computation primitive: see
  [candle_compute.ml](candle_compute.ml) and
  [compute_examples.ml](compute_examples.ml) for examples.

# Requirements and Installation

Candle requires the CakeML compiler. The latest release of the compiler can be
found [here](https://github.com/CakeML/cakeml/releases).

The CakeML compiler requires a x64_64 Linux machine with a C compiler and make.
The CakeML compiler assembly stubs need to be modified to work with Candle.
Please see [build-instructions.sh](build-instructions.sh) for instructions on
how to do this. You can also run

  > $ ./build-instructions.sh

from the shell, which will download the CakeML compiler using curl, and patch
it. After this, you can run Candle by writing either:

  > $ ./cake --candle

or:

  > $ ./candle

from the shell. Then, load the HOL Light sources by writing:

  > #use "hol.ml";;

into the REPL.

# Compatibility and Porting

Candle supports much (but not all) of the HOL Light 'base' theories and scripts.
See [hol.ml](hol.ml) for a list of the files that are loaded by Candle. Notable
omissions are:

- the help system
- the theorem database
- metis and compute

Most proof scripts that contain tactic proofs will be accepted by Candle with no
changes. However, because Candle runs on CakeML (not OCaml), there are some
things that Candle does differently, notably:

- CakeML does not support let-polymorphism.
- There is no polymorphic comparison (Pervasives.compare). However, most types
  can be compared for equality using the standard operator (=). Other uses
  require changing your code to use type-specific comparison functions. See e.g.
  setify in lib.ml.
- Pointer equality does not work. There is a stub for (==) in Candle that always
  evaluates to false.
- Expression-level modules and functors are not supported, nor is the 'open'
  declaration.
